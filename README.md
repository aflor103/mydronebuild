<h2>Description</h2>
This project consisted of me building a sub 250 gram 3.5 inch FPV Drone. (Sub 250g to adhere to FAA Drone Laws). In this project I utilizied different skills such as circuit debugging, soldering, wire management, hardware troublshooting, power loop verification, signal tracing and continuity testing, vibration and noies mitigation and safety when handeling Lithiun-Polymer batteries. In this video I walk you through a brief overview of build whilst telling you any troubles that I came across and how I was able to fix them!
